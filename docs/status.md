## Current Blockers

### 🔴 High Priority
- None currently

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- **AI Model Selection**: Need to finalize which local AI models to support
- **Plugin Security**: Research sandboxing approaches for Go plugins

### 🟢 Low Priority
- **Theme System**: Decide on theme configuration format
- **Voice Integration**: Evaluate speech-to-text libraries

## Team & Resources

### Core Team
- **Lead Developer**: TBD
- **AI Specialist**: TBD
- **UI/UX**: TBD

### Resource Needs
- [ ] Go developer with CLI experience
- [ ] AI/ML engineer for context analysis
- [ ] DevOps engineer for CI/CD setup

## Technical Debt & Risks

### Current Technical Debt
- None (early stage)

### Identified Risks
1. **AI Model Performance**: Local AI may be too slow for real-time suggestions
   - *Mitigation*: Hybrid local/cloud approach with caching
2. **Plugin Security**: Go plugin system has security limitations
   - *Mitigation*: Research WASM-based plugin system
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Terminal features vary across platforms
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing on target platforms

## Metrics & KPIs

### Development Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Target 80% (Current: N/A)
- **Build Time**: Target <30s (Current: N/A)
- **Test Suite Runtime**: Target <5min (Current: N/A)

### User Experience Metrics (Post-MVP)
- **Startup Time**: Target <100ms
- **AI Response Time**: Target <2s (local), <5s (cloud)
- **Memory Usage**: Target <50MB baseline

## Next Actions

### This Week
1. Set up Go project structure with Cobra CLI
2. Implement basic configuration management
3. Create initial plugin interface definitions
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Next Week
1. Integrate Bubble Tea for terminal UI
2. Implement project detection algorithms
3. Create first tech stack module (Go)
4. Set up testing framework

## Communication

### Weekly Updates
- **When**: Every Friday
- **Format**: Status update in project channel
- **Attendees**: Core team

### Sprint Reviews
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Next Review**: TBD

## Notes
- Focus on MVP features first, avoid feature creep
- Prioritize developer experience and performance
- Keep plugin system simple initially, expand later
- Document all architectural decisions for future reference
